# Sekiro, Control, and Progression — Reflections During Uncertainty

> *A personal reflection on how Sekiro’s combat philosophy clashes with — and ultimately strengthens — my instincts as an engineer and system builder, and how its lessons apply to surviving uncertainty without losing myself.*

## 1. Defeating the First Horse General — and the Rules That Were Broken

### The experience

I defeated the first major boss in Sekiro — the horse-mounted general — only after dying dozens of times. The victory did not come from mechanical optimization or memorizing a checklist of moves. Instead, it came from:

* Prolonged observation
* Letting patterns emerge naturally
* Internalizing rhythm rather than predicting sequences
* Reacting correctly *moment by moment*

At some point, I stopped thinking about winning. I simply *knew* when attacks were coming, blocked most of them, evaded only when necessary, and the fight resolved itself.

The victory felt earned — but also unsettling — because the game violated two of my deepest personal rules.

---

### My two golden rules (and how Sekiro breaks them)

**Rule 1 — “Don’t move on until I can reliably win.”**  
In engineering and system mastery, I do not advance unless I can reproduce success deterministically. Reliability precedes progression.

**Rule 2 — “I should have a training ground before real fights.”**  
In real systems, learning should happen in safe, isolated environments. Production is not a classroom.

Sekiro violates both rules intentionally:

* You are expected to move forward *without* guaranteed mastery
* The real fight *is* the training ground
* Failure is not an exception — it is the primary teaching mechanism

This directly clashes with my engineering instincts, which are oriented around control, predictability, invariants, and minimizing retries.

---

### What Sekiro actually rewards

Sekiro does **not** reward:

* Planning the win
* Predictive control
* Perfect foresight
* Playing “safe”

Sekiro *does* reward:

* Precision in the present moment
* Recovery after mistakes
* Late, calm reactions
* Information extraction from failure
* Trusting perception over anticipation

This is not system mastery — it is *human execution mastery under uncertainty*.

---

### The key reconciliation

Sekiro is not training me to build worse systems.

It is training **me** — the human operator — to remain effective when systems, environments, or outcomes are not under my control.

The complement is intentional:

* **Systems I design** should minimize uncertainty for others
* **I** must be capable of standing inside uncertainty without collapsing

Sekiro strengthens the second without eroding the first — *as long as the boundary is explicit*.

## 2. Winning Collapses Perception; Correct Action Restores It

### The core realization

> **The moment I try to “win,” my perception collapses.**
> **The moment I focus on the next correct action, clarity returns.**

This is not metaphorical. It is mechanically enforced by the game.

---

### What happens when I try to win

* Attention jumps ahead of the present
* I start predicting instead of perceiving
* My body tenses
* Deflects happen too early
* Dodges become panic responses
* Rhythm breaks

In Sekiro, this is punished immediately.

---

### What happens when I focus on the next correct action

* Attention narrows to *now*
* The next deflect becomes obvious
* Timing naturally shifts later and calmer
* The fight slows down perceptually
* Success emerges as a side effect

Victory is no longer pursued — it *happens*.

---

### How Sekiro enforces this psychologically

Sekiro forces:

* Single-action objectives ("deflect this" not "beat him")
* Acceptance of death as information, not failure
* Continuous re-entry into the present moment
* Letting outcomes emerge rather than being forced

Trying to control the outcome degrades performance. Letting go of outcome obsession restores precision.

## 3. Adjusting My Stance — In Game and In Life

### Objective recalibration (gameplay)

To align with what Sekiro is actually teaching, I must consciously adjust my objective away from winning and toward **local correctness**.

**Correct objective:**

* Extract one insight per failure
* Execute the *next* correct action clearly
* Narrow focus to a single, survivable task (e.g., one deflect, one dodge, one recovery)
* Treat bosses as diagnostics, not gates

**Incorrect objective:**

* Wanting to win
* Forcing progress
* Proving competence
* Becoming sweaty due to outcome fixation

Sekiro rewards *methodical presence*, not hunger for victory.

---

### Mood and nervous‑system stance (the missing layer)

Understanding the mindset is **not sufficient**. The body must also learn that the situation is survivable.

Key insight:

> **Calm is not required. Presence is.**

Sweaty feet, elevated heart rate, and tension indicate sympathetic nervous‑system activation — not failure. The goal is not to eliminate arousal, but to remain precise *through* it.

Practical adjustments:

* **Physically shrink the objective** before each attempt ("This run is only about the first two deflects")
* **Lengthen the exhale** during brief downtime to signal safety to the nervous system
* **Explicitly allow physical arousal** instead of resisting it ("Sweat is allowed")
* **Insert one deliberately non‑optimal action** per fight to break outcome compulsion

These bottom‑up signals gradually retrain the nervous system to operate without panic.

---

### Transfer to real life under uncertainty

This stance maps directly onto volatile, low‑control environments:

* Job instability
* Delayed feedback
* Outcomes outside my authority

Trying to "win" such situations collapses perception and induces anxiety. The Sekiro stance is:

> *“I do not need to control the outcome to act correctly.”*

What remains under control:

* The next correct action
* Information extracted per step
* Integrity of method
* Emotional composure under activation

This allows me to stand in uncertainty without flinching.

---

### Final synthesis

This is a **situational operating mode**, not a permanent philosophy.

* In crisis: progression over outcome
* In construction: reliability before advancement

Sekiro is training my capacity to function under activation, so that when stability returns, I can resume building deterministic systems without fragility.

Victory — in the game and in life — is a **side effect of correct local actions**, not something to be forced.

For now, the ground is shaking.

I am learning how to stand.
