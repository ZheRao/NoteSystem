# What PATH Signals on the Open Market

This document translates the **PATH data system work** into **clear, market-readable signals**.
It answers one question:

> *If someone competent looks at this work, what do they actually learn about you?*

This is **not a resume rewrite**. It is a signal-decomposition map.

## 1. High-Level Signal Summary

PATH signals **senior systems thinking under real constraints**, not dashboarding skill.

At a glance, it communicates:

* You replace spreadsheets when they structurally fail
* You design systems around questions, not tools
* You integrate across organizational silos (Finance, Grain, Produce)
* You operate effectively in ambiguous, high-pressure environments

This places you **above** typical BI / analytics roles.

## 2. Signal by Capability Layer

### 2.1 Problem Framing (Rare)

**Market signal:**

> “This person knows *when* spreadsheets stop being the right abstraction.”

Evidence from PATH:

* Identified YoY analysis, decomposition, and trend tracking as the *real* questions
* Built PATH specifically where Excel reconciliation became error-prone and slow
* Anchored visuals to executive decision paths, not data availability

Why this matters:

* Most analysts wait for requirements
* You inferred the *structural failure point* of existing tools

This signals **principal-level framing ability**.

### 2.2 System Architecture (Very Strong)

**Market signal:**

> “This person designs durable internal systems, not one-off dashboards.”

Evidence:

* Cross-pillar integration (Finance → Grain → Produce)
* Canonical definitions and shared metrics
* Reusable decomposition logic (location, crop, customer)
* Explicit invariants (years, categories, labels, backgrounds)

Why this matters:

* Replaces ad-hoc reporting with an internal platform
* Demonstrates thinking in invariants and interfaces

Comparable market reference:

* Internal analytics platforms
* ERP / NetSuite-class replacement logic (without vendor cost)

---

### 2.3 Decision-Oriented Visualization (Understood, Not Cosmetic)

**Market signal:**

> “This person understands perception as part of the system.”

Evidence:

* Question-first visual design
* Strict separation of semantic layers
* Color treated as a constrained resource
* Designs that survive grayscale, printing, and skimming

Why this matters:

* Executives trust systems that don’t lie visually
* Reduces cognitive load and decision latency

This is closer to **information architecture** than design.

## 3. What This Is *Not* Mistaken For

Correct interpretation avoids these traps:

* ❌ BI report builder
* ❌ Power BI specialist
* ❌ Dashboard designer
* ❌ SQL-only analyst

Correct framing:

> **Systems-minded analytics engineer / data architect with executive context awareness**

## 4. Role Archetypes This Signals Alignment With

Strong alignment:

* Analytics Engineer (senior / staff)
* Data Platform Engineer (internal tooling)
* Principal Data Scientist (systems-heavy orgs)
* Finance / Ops Intelligence Architect

Partial alignment:

* ML Engineer (infrastructure-focused)
* Research Engineer (applied systems)

Weak alignment:

* Ad-hoc BI / reporting roles
* Visualization-only roles

## 5. The Most Important Meta-Signal

> **You create order where entropy is rising.**

This is one of the rarest and most transferable professional signals.

It applies to:

* Scaling organizations
* Early platforms
* Future AI systems (long-term)

## 6. One-Sentence Market Translation

If reduced to one honest sentence:

> *“I design internal systems that replace spreadsheets when complexity crosses the trust threshold, and I do it in a way executives can actually think with.”*

That sentence is portable.
