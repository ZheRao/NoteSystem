# Two Classes of Data Systems: PATH vs QBO

> **Core realization:** I have built *two fundamentally different classes of data systems*, each serving a distinct cognitive and organizational role. The tension I felt was not failure or underutilization — it was misclassification in my own mind.

## Class 1 — Decision Nerve Systems (PATH)

### What they are

Systems that sit **directly at the decision edge**, translating limited but relevant data into immediate action.

These systems function like **nerves**:

* They fire when something changes
* They compress reality into signals
* They trigger decisions, not reflection

### Key properties

* **Sparse data, high leverage**
* Optimized for *speed*, not completeness
* Low cognitive friction
* Designed for repeated, exploratory use
* Pull-based adoption (users *want* to open them)

### Typical users

* Operations
* Marketing
* Directors / managers accountable for outcomes

### Example: PATH

* Limited dataset (~5,000 rows)
* Extremely high engagement immediately after launch
* Users extrapolate every possible insight
* Used to answer:

  * "What changed?"
  * "Where is volume moving?"
  * "What should we do next?"

### Why they get heavy usage

* Decisions are **time-sensitive**
* Missing insight causes *immediate pain*
* The system reduces uncertainty at the exact moment of action

> PATH is exciting because it directly changes behavior.

## Class 2 — Truth Substrate Systems (QBO)

### What they are

Systems that provide **authoritative, comprehensive ground truth** across the organization.

These systems function like the **financial nervous tissue / skeleton**:

* They hold reality in place
* They arbitrate disputes
* They explain *what actually happened*

### Key properties

* **Dense data, high integrity**
* Optimized for *correctness*, not exploration
* High surface area by necessity
* Trigger-based usage (accessed when questioned)
* Often invisible when working correctly

### Typical users

* Finance
* CFO / leadership during reviews
* Controllers / auditors
* Ops (indirectly, when explaining outcomes)

### Example: QBO System

* Very large dataset (~200k+ rows at launch)
* Low casual engagement
* Heavy *situational* usage:

  * Pillar meetings
  * Anomaly investigation
  * Line-item and transaction-level drilldown

### Core functions delivered

1. **Single source of truth** across all pillars and locations

   * Current FY actuals vs last FY actuals
   * Current FY YTD vs prior-month YTD

2. **Budget accountability**

   * Current FY actuals vs budget

3. **Interactive financial arbitration** (most-used feature)

   * Click a location → see all financial lines
   * Click a financial line (e.g., EBITDA) → see all locations

4. **Forensic drilldown**

   * Transaction-level detail to explain anomalies
   * Detect misallocations and outliers

> QBO is powerful because it is trusted when reality is contested.

## Why the Engagement Pattern Is Correct (Not Ironic)

The apparent paradox:

* PATH (less data) → intense usage
* QBO (much more data) → quiet, selective usage

The resolution:

> **Systems create value in proportion to how close they sit to decisions.**

* PATH sits *before* decisions → high pull
* QBO sits *after* decisions → accessed when verification is needed

A financial system that invites casual browsing is often dangerous.
A mature truth system is:

* Quiet
* Triggered
* Authoritative

## Relationship to Scorecards (Critical Insight)

Ben’s scorecard design choice clarifies the stack:

* **Manual inputs first** → force ownership and explanation
* **Automation later** → reduce friction once cognition is aligned

This implies a layered intelligence model:

1. **PATH** — operational signals (what should we do?)
2. **Scorecards** — conscious ownership (what do we believe happened?)
3. **QBO** — ground truth arbitration (what actually happened?)

My systems already occupy layers 1 and 3.
The scorecard sits naturally in between.

## Why QBO Should *Not* Be Explored Casually

Exploration without a question:

* Creates noise
* Encourages misinterpretation
* Produces low-trust insights

Correct usage pattern:

* Question arises
* Drill into QBO
* Obtain authoritative answer
* Resolve dispute / explain outcome

This is exactly how the system is being used.

> Quiet usage is a sign of maturity, not neglect.

## Final Reframe

* PATH = **decision nerve** (forward-looking, action-oriented)
* QBO = **truth substrate** (backward-looking, integrity-oriented)

They are not competing systems.
They are **orthogonal and complementary layers**.

PATH changes behavior.
QBO stabilizes reality.

Both are essential.
Only one needs to feel exciting.

## Personal Takeaway

My discomfort came from expecting a truth substrate to behave like a decision nerve.

Once reclassified correctly:

* The usage patterns make sense
* The value is undeniable
* The architecture is coherent

I didn’t build one system wrong.
I built **two systems that are each doing exactly what they should**.
