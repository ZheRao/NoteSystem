# 2026 Milestones

This document tracks **completed, production-grade milestones** in 2026.

A milestone represents a **closed loop**:
- Real system or capability delivered
- Clear scope and boundaries
- Documented sufficiently for handoff or future reference
- No ongoing cognitive load

This is **not a task list**.  
Only outcomes that permanently change my trajectory are recorded here.

## Milestones

### 2026-01-09 — Twilio WhatsApp SOP Retrieval Engine (Closed)

**Category:** System Building / Operations  
**Status:** Deployed, documented, and closed  

#### What was delivered
- A deterministic WhatsApp-based SOP retrieval engine using Twilio Functions
- Keyword-based document matching with intersection/union logic
- Fully documented codebase and system behavior
- Real-user validation completed (tested by Mike)

#### Why this matters
- Demonstrates end-to-end ownership: design → implementation → documentation → deployment
- Reinforces deterministic systems over probabilistic AI in safety-sensitive workflows
- Establishes a repeatable pattern for small, high-leverage operational tools

#### Constraints & design choices
- No NLP or AI components (intentional determinism)
- No authentication or access control (explicit business decision)
- Static asset-based retrieval for reliability and auditability

#### Closure note
This project is **intentionally closed**.
No further features, refactors, or extensions unless explicitly re-scoped in the future.
