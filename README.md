# NoteSystem

An evolving **cognition index** and **knowledge navigation system**.
Designed to support long-horizon thinking, system building, and identity-level learning.

This repository makes a deliberate transition:
- from `.txt`-based **raw capture**
- to `.md`-based **structure thinking**

> **Clean medium → clean structure → clean momentum**

## Purpose

NoteSystem is not a notebook. It is
- a **retrieval-first thinking system**
- an **externalized prefrontal cortex**
- a place where thoughts can *live, mature,* and *be revisited* without **occupying working memory**

## Core Components

### 1. Deep Learning

A structured reconstruction of modern deep learning from first principles, paired with long-term architectural exploration.

**1.1 Foundational study**
- *Deep Learning* — Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville
- *Dive into Deep Learning* — Zhang et al.

**1.2 From-scratch reconstruction**
- Autograd
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Recurrent Neural Networks
- Transformers

**1.3 Exploratory directions**
- Continuous perception systems (text-first)
- Hierarchical abstraction for understanding
    - Next-token prediction → next-idea prediction
- Memory as a **living, continuous internal state**
    - Selective consolidation based on identity impact
- Adaptive representational dimensionality
    - Representations expand and contract while preserving identity

### 2. DevOps & System Architecture

A layered path toward **infrastructure literacy** and **system fluency**, emphasizing understanding over tooling

**2.1 Layered progression**

0. **Operating system foundations**
    - Linux
1. **Environment & dependency management**
    - Build and package own libraries
    - Automated environment bootstrapping
2. **System integration & developer tooling**
    - Docker
    - GitHub actions
    - Makefiles
3. **Orchestration & automation**
    - CI/CD pipelines
    - Multi-service Docker Compose
    - Kubernetes
    - Logging & health checks
4. **Cloud infrastructure & platform engineering**
    - Azure VMs and containerized deployments
    - Terraform
    - Key Vault
    - Monitoring and observability
5. **Meta-infrastructure & reliability engineering**
    - Systems that scale, fail safely, and self-diagnose

**2.2 Knowledge indexing**

- **Concepts** — *why things work*
- **Tools** — *how things work*

### 3. Goals

A living record of yearly resolutions, milestones, and long-term direction.
Used to align daily work with multi-year trajectories.

## Design Philosophy

- Structure is not overhead - it is **leverage**
- Understanding compounds when:
    - ideas are explicit
    - systems are layered
    - retrieval is frictionless
