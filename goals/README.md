# 2026 New Year's Resolutions

## 1. Project Northern Light

- Finish Linear Algebra chapter from *Deep Learning*; continue at ≥ 1 chapter/month
- Write a `.md` note for every **foundational conceptual breakthrough**
- Implement **autograd** from scratch → clean, structured repo
- Implement tiny **CNN** + tiny **RNN** from scratch
    - Validate on MNIST + one simple semantic task
    - One documented repo per project
- Build **RNN-as-Embedding Prototype v1**

## 2. System Building @ Monette

- Complete **v1 refactor** for all systems - *each documented & structured*
    - QBO
    - QBO Time
    - Harvest Profit
- Fully internalize **TDD + disciplined logging** as default behavior
- Study **1 Linux Command Line chapter/month**
    - refactor old notes into `.md`
- Explore **≥ 2 new system ideas**
    - Implement **1 new subsystem for Monette OS**
    - Might be another data system like [*qbo-etl*](https://github.com/ZheRao/ETLCodeBase_Spark)
    - Might be another project like [*whatsapp-doc-retrieval-engine*](https://github.com/ZheRao/whatsapp-doc-retrieval-engine)
- Document **best practices** continuously (TDD, logging, architecture)
