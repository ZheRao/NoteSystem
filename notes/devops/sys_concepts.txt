Python Environments


    - environment vs. virtual environment 

        -- environment 
            --- means a collection of 
                ---- a Python interpreter (the executable 'python')
                ---- a set of installed packages 
                ---- and a specific set of environment variables (like PATH, PYTHONPATH, etc.) that together determine what code runs, and how 
            --- your system Python is itself an environment 
                ---- /usr/bin/python3 
                ---- /usr/lib/python3.10/site-pacakges/
                ---- that's the global environment - all users share it 
        
        -- virtual environment - the isolated implementation
            --- a 'venv' is a self-contained copy of a Python environment 
                ---- it has its own interpreter binary (venv/bin/python)
                ---- it maintains its own 'site-packages' directory (where packages are installed) 
                ---- it "inherits" the standard library from the system Python but isolates dependencies 
            --- when you activate it, your shell teporarily rewires PATH so 'python' and 'pip' point to that virtual copy, not the system one 


 Linux Runtime

    - binary 

        -- general meaning 
            --- a binary is a file that contains compiled machine code - the 1s and 0s (binary digits) that you CPU can directly execute 
            --- it's called "binary" because its content isn't human-readable text - it's stored in binary (base-2) format, representing CPU instructions, memory addresses, and data
        
        -- binary in software terms
            --- code in high-level languages like Python or C, computer can't run that directly; it must be turned into something your processor understands
                ---- for C/C++, that's done by a compiler, which produces a binary executable (e.g., 'python', 'bash', 'ls')
                ---- for Python, the interpreter itself is a binary - written in C, compiled into an executable file 
            --- so /usr/bin/python3 
                ---- that's the Python interpreter binary - an executable machine-code program that runs on your CPU and knows how to 
                        -> read.py text file 
                        -> parse them into bytecode 
                        -> execute that bytecode line by line 
        
        -- what the /bin folder means 
            --- bin is short for binaries - it's where executable programs live 

            --- typical Linux hierarchy 
                /bin/           → essential system binaries (e.g., bash, ls, cat)
                /usr/bin/       → user-level binaries (e.g., python3, git)
                /usr/local/bin/ → locally installed binaries

            --- in virtual environment
                venv/
                ├── bin/
                │   ├── python       ← the Python binary (executable)
                │   ├── pip          ← the pip command (script wrapper)
                │   ├── activate     ← shell script (text file)
                │   └── ... 

    - Spark Compatibility: why is Windows unstable 

        -- gist: Spark was designed and battle-tested on Unix-like systems; on Windows, several low-level mismatches bite - especially inside partitions where Python workers and JVM executors churn hard 
        
        -- process model & signals
            --- Spark executors launch many short-lived Python workers; on Linux this leans on POSIX semantics (fork/exec, signal delivery, process groups)
            --- Windows lacks POSIX signals/fork; process startup is heavier; termination/cleanup is less reliable
                ---- orphaned workers, slow teardown, weird "point in use" errors, and falky retry behavior during 'mapPartitions'
        
        -- networking & ports 
            --- Python workers talk to the JVM over local sockets 
            --- Windows firewalls/AV, IPv6/IPv4 quirks, and ephemeral-port exhaustion show up more often 
            --- Linux networking stacks handle these high-churn localhost sockets more preditably 
        
        -- filesystem/path semantics 
            --- Spark/Hadoop routines assume POSIX paths, symlinks, and premissive temp-dir behavior 
            --- Windows path rules (backslashes, drive letters, MAX_PATH surprises, case-insensitivity) cause random "file not found" or staging failures mid-task 
        
        -- shell/bootstrap scripts 
            --- Spark/Hadoop ship tons of Bash scripts 
            --- on Windows they run via workarounds (e.g., 'cmd', Cygwin-like layers)
            --- edge cases (CRLF vs LF line endings, environment expansion, quoting) can break executor setup under load
        
        -- Hadoop/winutils baggage
            --- historically you needed 'winutils.exe' and special envs to emulate *nix features 
            --- even with newer Spark, some code paths still assume Unixy behavior - showing up as flaky IO/permissions during shuffle and temp work 
        
        -- Python/native deps 
            --- in partitions you often pull in 'pyarrow', 'pandas', 'numpy' (MKL/OpenBLAS), etc. 
            --- native wheels and memory-mapping behave more consistently on Linux 
            --- on Windows, you'll hit DLL resolution, file-locking, and shared-memory quirks more often under concurrency
        
        -- Antivirums & Defender 
            --- real-time scanning on %TEMP%/ project dirs can stall or lock temporary files that Spark shuffles and deletes aggressively in partition tasks
