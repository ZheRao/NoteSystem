    - perception layer (what the system can even see)
        
        -- Char-RNN eliminates the tokenizer bottleneck
            
            --- importance: foundational (nothing works without this)

            --- why it comes first
                
                ---- tokenization defines the input universe
                ---- if perception is broken or artificial, everything above it is corrupted

            --- core insights
                
                ---- characters are the only stable atomic symbols
                ---- words must emerge, not be predefined
                ---- this removes OOV, BPE collisions, retraining, and language lock-in

            --- enables
                
                ---- open-vocabulary learning
                ---- misspellings, slang, multilinguality
                ---- symmetric decoding (thought -> text)

            --- without this, the rest is cosmetic

    - representation structure (how maning is formed)

        -- hiearachical abstraction is required for understanding
            
            --- importance: structural necessity

            --- why it comes next:

                ---- once perception is clean, you must organize it
                ---- flat representations cannot scale meaning

            --- core insight
                
                ---- cognition requires layered compression
                        -> char - word - sentence - idea
                ---- each layer removes noise and adds invariance

            --- enbales
                
                ---- separation of language form vs. meaning
                ---- specialized processing at each scale
                ---- efficient reasoning

            --- this is where "understanding" first becomes possible

    - temporal scaling (how understanding persists over time)
        
        -- streaming + compression is the only escape from fixed context windows

            --- importance: mathematical inevitability

            --- why it comes next:
                
                ---- hierarchy alone still fails on long sequences
                ---- time must be handled explicitly

            --- core insights:
                
                ---- O(N^2) attention cannot scale indefinitely
                ---- infinite context requires:
                        -> streaming input
                        -> repeated local compression
                        -> constant-size evolving state

            --- enables
                
                ---- unlimited context
                ---- no padding, no block limits
                ---- real-time cognition

            --- this is where the model becomes a process, not a static function

    - memory & identity (what the system is)

        -- memory must be a living, continuous internal state
            
            --- importance: identity-level

            --- why it comes next:
                
                ---- streaming requires somewhere for meaning to go
                ---- logs and replay are anti-cognitive

            --- core insight:
                
                ---- memory is not stored events
                ---- memory is compressed meaning
                ---- memory = identity

            --- enables:
                
                ---- persistent understanding
                ---- personality/values/long-term coherence
                ---- no need to giant contexts

            --- this is the moment the system becomes an "organism"

    - compute allocation (how thinking stays efficient)

        -- attention should be applied only when meaningfully needed

            --- importance: optimization by necessity

            --- why it comes next:
                
                ---- living memory + streaming makes global attention wasteful
                ---- attention must become a tool, not a default

            --- core insight:
                
                ---- RNN updates are cheap
                ---- Attention is expensive
                ---- use attention only when abstraction breaks

            --- enables:
                
                ---- efficient inference
                ---- biological plausibility
                ---- emergent focus

            --- this is elegance replacing brute force

    - cognition proper (how thoughts are generated)

        -- meaning must be generated in semantic (idea) space, not token space

            --- importance: true cognition

            --- why it comes next
                
                ---- once memory and attention are sane, generation must change
                ---- tokens are expression, not thought

            --- core insight
                
                ---- next-token prediction is not thinking
                ---- thought happens in abstract semantic space
                ---- language is a randering layer

            --- pipeline
                
                ---- state - idea vector - setence - words - characters

            --- enbales
                
                ---- planning
                ---- reasoning
                ---- creativity
                ---- intentional output

            --- this is the split between parroting and thinking

    - feature extraction (how rich meaning is built) 

        -- parallel feature maps via many small RNNs

            --- importance: representational power 

            --- why it comes next:

                ---- idea-space needs rich inputs
                ---- single streams entangle signals

            --- core insight
                
                ---- temporal CNN analogy holds
                ---- multiple small RNNs = multiple feature channels
                ---- features specialize naturally

            --- enbales
                
                ---- disentangled representations
                ---- robust abstraction
                ---- modular cognition

            --- this is where intelligence gains texture

    - boundary alignment (where compression is allowed)

        -- discretize only at meaningful separators
        
            --- importance: stability & alignment

            --- why it comes next
                
                ---- compression must respect meaning boundaries
                ---- arbitrary cuts destroy structure
            
            --- core insight
                
                ---- punctuation and structure are semantic signals
                ---- token boundaries are not

            --- enables
                
                ---- stable segments
                ---- better memory updates
                ---- cleaner hierarchy

            --- this keeps the whole system from fracturing

    - the unsolved core (what limits future intelligence)
        
        -- adaptive representational dimensionality
            
            --- importance: evetual ceiling

            --- why it comes next:
                
                ---- everything else must exist first
                ---- this governs growth itself

            --- core insight

                ---- fixed dimensions cap intelligence
                ---- real systems expand and contract
                ---- identity must persist across change

            --- sits at the heart of 
                
                ---- living memory
                ---- streaming cognition
                ---- open-ended learning

            --- this is not today's problem - it's the lock on tomorrow
