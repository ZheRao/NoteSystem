    - Q3

        -- October 

            --- 29th 

                ---- setup: Linux project/notes space, installed python and jupyter 

                ---- DevOps: Y1-Q1 plan structure created - with month1-week1 detailed target created  
            
            --- 30th

                ---- DevOps: In Progress - venv
                        -> create/activate/deactivate/install packages with 'venv'
                        -> why venv? -> isolation, dependency management, avoid system pollution 
                        -> folder structure of venv, access to standard python library even not included in installation 
                
                ---- completed notes on first-time WSL set up in VS Code 

                ---- other notes 
                        -> system: environment vs. virtual environment 
                        -> systen: binary - machine executable code 
                        -> Spark: compatibility with Windows vs. Linux (WSL)
            
            --- 31th

                ---- skipped - day trip to Saskatoon 
        
        -- Novmber 

            --- 1st 

                ---- DevOps: Finished - venv (3.72 hours)
                        -> execution of isolation and lightweight Python installation through 'pyvenv.cfg' file, modify sys.path, PYTHONPATH, PATH
                        -> customize virtualenv: update core dependencies, include system site-packages
                        -> manage virtualenv: locate venv folder, requirements.txt, avoid in Production 
                
                ---- DevOps: week2 plan created - realized adjustment needed - focused on working with virtualevn in Poetry + Conda, determine - is it really needed? 
                
                ---- DeepLearning: Y1-Q1 plan structure created - with month1-week1 detailed target created (switched 3 plans - 1 hour)
            
            --- 2nd 

                ---- DeepLearning: micrograd (2.5)
                        -> overall idea: construct computational graph, so back propagation can be implemented easily from chain rule
                        -> derivative concepts #1 - numeric comutation 
                        -> constructed basic 'Value' class 
                        -> working on functions to visualize computational graph - learning traversal of nodes
